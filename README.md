# Example Project
An simple streaming and authentication example written in C++.

# Security practice
We like to help our customers with keeping high security maintanence compared to other authentication systems to prevent our users losing money to piracy.
You can always contact us about security and we also have a [small security library](https://github.com/xen0napp/security) with some amazing anti reversal.
Our authentication system does not provide encrypted communication when authenticating but it does when streaming using tokens to derive keys, etc. We do not recommend using this application without streaming the important thing, for a spoofer? Stream the driver!
